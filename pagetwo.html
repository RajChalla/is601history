        <li>The Browser Wars:</li>
        <p>The battle between America's corporation, Microsoft, and a
            small tech group of "computer geeks" who created a revolution in technology and
            the Internet explosion.BROWSER WARS reveals how a small group of college
            students from the University of Illinois became Netscape's core programmers and
            changed the digital landscape.And atlast Microsoft ended up winning the
            browser wars, and Internet Explorer set a landmark of dominance in the market
            between 1990s.</p>

        <li>The Search Wars:</li>
        <p>The internet is a new kind of medium which was always
            supported by advertising.Internet search started in the year 1970s.The first
            search engine was introduced in 1990 which is named as archie and on many
            search engines was introduced named veronica and Gopher.Fortunately for early
            users, the first web designers set to work creating search engines. Indeed the
            first of them, the WWW Virtual Library, was created by the Web's creator, Tim
            Berners-Lee.Even though many search engines were introduced which hit the
            market widely,Google managed to overcome those all search engines and
            Google simply did a much better job than its rivals of making search easy and
            comprehensive. The key to Google's overwhelming success was PageRank.
            With PageRank, Google rates the relevancy of webpages to queries, based not
            only on whether the pages contain the search terms (the technique used by all
            search engines), but also by how many relevant pages link to it.No company
            gave serious competition to google for many years.</p>

            decade came to its end.The dot-com bubble ix also known as the dot-com boom
            and it was a period of extreme growth in the usage and adoption of the Internet
            across the world.The two main factors that led to burst of internet bubble are:The
            use of metrics that hit the cash flow,Significantly overvalued stocks.</p>

        <li>What is the Internet?</li>
        <p>In the 1990s Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn invented the design of the internet.Internet
            is made up of a large number of independently operated networks.Internet is a
            network that connects computers all across the world.Internet uses a packet
            routing network that follows IP and TCP.Its a tangible physical system made to
            move information.
            Information on the internet goes from one computer to another using packet
            switching.</p>

            browser and the Web server talk to each other using a special language called
